## About Me

I have been working as a professional web developer since 2016. I learned by building web apps and tools to help me in my previous career as a bookkeeper for small businesses and nonprofits.

When I'm not working, I enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, gardening, being outdoors, playing guitar and live music, traveling, and gaming.
